# School District Analysis

## Overview

This project uses Python and the Pandas library to perform transformation and analysis on datasets in csv format. After the data is cleaned up we group and analysze the data by different metrics to present an overview of the performance of the students in this school district.

### Purpose

The school board has been given evidence suggesting academic dishonesty. The math and reading scores for the Thomas High School ninth grade students are suspected to have been tampered with and throw into doubt the accuracy of the previous analysis. After replacing the suspect grades with NaN, the analysis needs to be repeated.
